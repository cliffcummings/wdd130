    Your HTML document should be valid and contain an <h1> heading that is appropriate for the content.
Each form element (e.g., <input>, <textarea>, <select>, etc.) should be coupled with an associated label element.
Remember, that there are two ways to associate labels with form elements. Either way is appropriate but stick with one method.
The following form input elements and settings are required in the quiz:

    A text type input. (fill in the blank question)
        Assign both the name and id attribute values as "q1".
    A textarea element. (short answer question)
        Assign both the name and id attribute values as "q2".
    A select element. (dropdown or combo box)
        Assign both the name and id attribute values as "q3".
        The select element should have at least three (3) options with values.
        If you want the first option to be labeled and non-selectable, you can add an option element with an empty value attribute and the attributes of selected and disabled like this:

        <option value="" selected disabled>Choose One ...</option>

    A number type input element. (integer answer)
        Assign both the name and id attribute values as "q4".

The form requires a button of type submit with the text "Submit Quiz".
